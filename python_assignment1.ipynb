    "Answer=  In Python, loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is true. There are primarily two types of loops \n",

    "          for loop\n",
    "          while loop\n",

    "         (a) for Loop\n",
    "             The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range). It executes a block of code for each item in the sequence. The for loop is generally used when you know the number of iterations or need to loop through items in a sequence.\n",
